# Unofficial Codeanywhere Browser Extension

## What is it?

This is an unofficial browser extension for Codeanywhere and GitHub. It allows a user to create a new workspace directly from GitHub with the click of a button.

You can either click the purple Codeanywhere button in GitHub, or click on the extension icon to open a new workspace.

Clicking on the extension icon when you're not on Gitpod simply opens the Codeanywhere workspaces page.

## It's not working!

Sometimes, after viewing a file, the button is not injected. To work around this either refresh the page or click the extension icon instead.

Oh, ok. I'm sorry about that. Please <a href="https://github.com/lechien73/cae/issues" target="_blank">open an issue here on GitHub</a>, and I'll take a look. The code itself is very straightforward, so if you know what's wrong, feel free <a href="https://github.com/lechien73/cae/" target="_blank">fork the repo</a>, fix it and create a Pull Request.

Please note that the extension is provided "as-is". No warranty or guarantee regarding suitability or compatibility is given. Use it at your own risk.

## How much data do you collect?

None, zilch, zip, nada. You can check the code for yourself. There's a <a href="https://mattrudge.net/privacy.html" target="_blank">funky privacy policy</a> too if you're still unconvinced.

## Anything else?

Well, now you come to mention it...if this extension makes your life a little bit easier, then I always accept an oat milk cappuccino.
